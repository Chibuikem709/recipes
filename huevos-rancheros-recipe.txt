Ingredients:
 - 2 small tomatoes
 - 1 small onion
 - 1 medium jalapeno pepper, chopped
 - 2 cloves garlic; 1 chopped, 1 smashed
 - 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce
 - 1 teaspoon ground cumin
 - Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
 - 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
 - 1 15 .5-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed
 - 4 large eggs
 - 4 6 -inch corn tortillas, warmed
 - 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
 - 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
 1. Prepare the salsa: Set a grater in a large bowl; grate the tomatoes and onion into the bowl. Add the
    jalapeno, chopped garlic, hot sauce, cumin and salt and pepper to taste. Heat a medium skillet over low heat and add 2 teaspoons olive oil. Fry the salsa in the oil until it thickens slightly, 3 minutes. Remove to a bowl and set aside.

 2. Add the beans to the same pan along with the smashed garlic, 1/2 cup warm water and a pinch of salt;
    cook over low heat until warmed through, smashing slightly with a fork.

 3. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in another skillet. Fry the eggs sunny-side up;
    season with pepper.

 4. Place 1 warm tortilla on each plate. Divide the beans among them, then top with a fried egg, some
    salsa and cheese. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve with the remaining salsa.
